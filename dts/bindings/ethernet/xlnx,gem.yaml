description: Xilinx GEM Ethernet controller

compatible: "xlnx,gem"

include: ethernet.yaml

properties:
    reg:
      required: true

    interrupts:
      required: true

    clock-frequency:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: TX Clock base frequency
        Specifies the base clock frequency from which the GEM's TX clock
        frequency will be derived using two dividers in the respective GEM's
        clock control register in the SLCR. The GEM's TX clock frequency
        is determined by the current link speed reported by the PHY, to
        which it will be adjusted at run-time. Therefore, the value of this
        item must be set to the clock frequency of the PLL supplying the
        respective GEM's TX clock - by default, this is the IO PLL.

    clk-ctrl-reg:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: TX Clock frequency control register address
        The address of the respective GEM's TX clock control register
        (GEMx_REF_CTRL in the CRL_APB register space on ZynqMP).

    mdc-divider:
      type: int
      required: true
      description: The MDC clock divider for the respective GEM. This is the
        divider applied to the cpu_1x clock in order to derive MDIO interface
        clock driving communications with the attached PHY. Refer to the
        Zynq-7000 TRM (Xilinx document ID UG585), Appendix B, documentation of
        register XEMACPS_NWCFG, p. 1274 ff., bits 20:18 to determine the
        appropriate divider for the target's cpu_1x clock frequency.
