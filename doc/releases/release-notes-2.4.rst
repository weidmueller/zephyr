API Changes
***********

* Moved to using C99 integer types and deprecate Zephyr integer types.  The
  Zephyr types can be enabled by Kconfig DEPRECATED_ZEPHYR_INT_TYPES option.

* The ``<sys/util.h>`` header has been promoted to a documented API with
  :ref:`experimental stability <api_lifecycle>`. See :ref:`util_api` for an API
  reference.

* The :c:func:`wdt_feed` function will now return ``-EAGAIN`` if
  issuing a feed would stall the caller.  Application code may need to
  ignore this diagnostic result or initiate another feed operation
  later.

Deprecated in this release
==========================


Removed APIs in this release
============================

* Other

  * The deprecated ``MACRO_MAP`` macro has been removed from the
    :ref:`util_api`. Use ``FOR_EACH`` instead.
